    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This has been my go-to side dish for weeks now, and they will definitely
      be making an appearance in our Easter spread. It’s quick, it’s easy, and
      it’s oh-so-buttery. It truly is the most perfect side dish to any meal –
      to any dinner or any holiday gathering. And it’s not heavy at all. Nope,
      it’s simply perfection.

    <p>
      Glazed carrots coated in a mixture of brown sugar and butter are a
      versatile side dish you can serve alongside a weeknight meatloaf, a Sunday
      ham, or your Thanksgiving turkey. These caramelized carrots are a definite
      kid-pleaser but they're elegant enough to impress the adults as well!

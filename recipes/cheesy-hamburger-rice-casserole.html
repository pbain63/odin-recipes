    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A five-ingredient hamburger rice casserole topped with melty cheese. My
      grandma used to make this and it was always a hit. She uses American
      cheese, but I make it with mozzarella. Very easy and yummy!

      Cheesy Hamburger Rice Casserole is an easy and delicious one-pan meal
      thatâ€™s perfect for the whole family.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A five-ingredient hamburger rice casserole topped with melty cheese. My
      grandma used to make this and it was always a hit. She uses American
      cheese, but I make it with mozzarella. Very easy and yummy!

      Cheesy Hamburger Rice Casserole is an easy and delicious one-pan meal

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
      <li>½ cup long grain white rice</li>
      <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and
        stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of
        mushroom soup, tomatoes, and uncooked rice. Cover, and simmer over low
        heat, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes.

      <br />
      <li>
        Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the
        contents of the skillet to a casserole dish. Cover with a layer of
        cheese.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Broil until the cheese is melted and toasty. Season with salt and pepper
        to taste, and enjoy!
